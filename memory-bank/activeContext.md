# Active Context: Process Baseline

## Current Task Status

**Primary Focus**: Validation and adoption planning (NEXT PHASE)  
**Recent Achievement**: Character limit improvements MERGED to main (PR #3)  
**Status**: Core implementation complete, moving to validation phase

## Recent Changes (Last Session)

### Character Limit Enhancement (Issue #2, PR #3)

**Problem Identified**: 
- Uniform 512/4048 character limits were truncating critical initial prompts
- Lost essential project context (pain points, solution approach, success criteria)
- Initial prompts establish foundational understanding but were treated same as follow-ups

**Solution Implemented**:
- **Differentiated character limits**: Initial prompts (complete) vs follow-up prompts (512-char rule)
- **Increased total limit**: 4048 â†’ 8000 characters to accommodate full context
- **Priority management**: Full initial prompt > key decisions > implementation details
- **Clear guidelines**: Added rationale, examples, and implementation guidance

**Files Modified**:
- `baseline-rules/workflow-enforcement.mdc`: Updated AI summary requirements section
  - Added Character Limits subsection with detailed guidelines
  - Included examples showing good vs bad truncation approaches
  - Provided rationale for different treatment of prompt types

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Validation and testing** (CURRENT PHASE)
   - Test new character limits with complex real-world scenarios
   - Validate initial prompt preservation vs follow-up truncation
   - Gather feedback from practical usage

### Potential Future Work
2. **Test implementation** of new character limits in practice
3. **Gather feedback** from team on improved guidelines
4. **Consider additional improvements** based on real-world usage
5. **Documentation updates** if guidelines need refinement

## Active Decisions

### RESOLVED: Character Limit Strategy
- **Decision**: Implement differentiated character limits for AI summaries
- **Rationale**: Initial prompts establish foundational context and cannot be meaningfully truncated
- **Implementation**: 8000 char total, complete initial prompts, 512-char follow-ups

### PENDING: Memory Bank Structure
- **Decision**: Establish comprehensive memory bank for process-baseline project
- **Status**: In progress - creating core files with project context

## Open Questions

1. Should we validate the new character limits with a real-world complex project?
2. Do we need additional examples for edge cases (very long initial prompts)?
3. How should we handle initial prompts that exceed 8000 characters?

## Context for Handoffs

### For Developers
- Process-baseline repository structure is established and functional
- Core workflow enforcement rules are implemented with improved character limits
- Installation system supports both merge and replace modes
- Documentation provides clear customization guidance

### For Reviewers
- Focus on practical usability of new character limit guidelines
- Verify examples clearly demonstrate good vs bad practices
- Check that rationale is compelling for different treatment of prompt types
- Ensure total character limits are realistic for complex projects

## Recent Learning

### Character Limit Analysis Insights
- **Consistent pattern**: 512/4048 limits used across noko-lsm, repeat-on-repos, jira-import-helper
- **Gap identified**: No differentiation between initial and follow-up prompt importance
- **Root cause**: Treating all prompts equally despite serving different purposes

### Implementation Insights
- Examples are crucial for clear understanding of new guidelines
- Rationale sections help adoption by explaining the "why" behind rules
- Priority ordering helps when making tradeoffs near character limits

## Work Environment Notes

- Working in `/Users/cathy/local-devel/sites/lullabot/baseline-process`
- Using GitHub CLI for issue and PR management
- Following established branch naming: `feature/BASELINE-{issue}--{description}`
- Scratch file pattern established for commits and PR descriptions
