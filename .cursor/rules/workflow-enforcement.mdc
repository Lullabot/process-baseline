# Workflow Enforcement Rules

These rules solve specific problems observed across Lullabot projects where AI assistants skip critical workflow steps.

## Branch Creation Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Problem Solved**: AI often makes changes directly to main branch instead of creating feature branches first.

### Requirements

You MUST create a feature branch before making ANY file changes:

1. **Check current branch**: Run `git branch --show-current` 
2. **If on main/master**: Create feature branch immediately
3. **Branch naming**: Use format `[ticket-id]--[short-description]` or `feature/[description]`
4. **No exceptions** unless user explicitly provides documented reason

### Implementation Steps

```bash
# REQUIRED before any file edits
git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
# OR with ticket reference  
git checkout -b PROJ-123--implement-feature
```

### When NOT to Create Branch

- User explicitly states "work directly on main" with documented reason
- Repository is in single-commit initialization phase
- Project uses different branching strategy (document in commit message)

## Commit Review Process (MANDATORY)

**Problem Solved**: AI skips review processes and uses poor commit messages.

### Requirements

Before ANY commit, you MUST:

1. **Create scratch file**: `temp_scratch_commit_msg.md` (auto-ignored)
2. **Review changes**: Show user `git diff --cached` and `git diff` output
3. **Draft message**: Write detailed commit message in scratch file
4. **User approval**: Get explicit approval before committing
5. **Execute**: `git commit -F temp_scratch_commit_msg.md`
6. **Cleanup**: Remove scratch file after successful commit

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): Brief description - Refs #123

Detailed explanation of:
- What was changed and why
- Testing performed  
- Any risks or considerations
- Links to relevant tickets/docs
```

### Check Before Committing

- **Branch status**: If branch pushed, MUST create new commit (no amending)
- **File permissions**: Flag any unintentional permission changes
- **Scope verification**: Ensure all changes are related and in scope

## AI Summary Requirements (MANDATORY)

**Problem Solved**: AI completes tasks without posting interaction summaries, losing context for humans.

### When Required

Post AI interaction summary when:
- Task is complete and ready for handoff
- Switching to different task or context
- User explicitly requests summary
- Creating or updating pull requests

### Summary Format

Post to issue/PR as comment using scratch file method:
- **AI Credit**: "Completed using [AI Agent] in [IDE]"
- **Prompt Count**: "Total user prompts: X"
- **Chronological History**: User prompts + AI response summaries (see Character Limits below)
- **Total Character Limit**: Max 8000 characters

### Character Limits

Different prompt types require different preservation approaches:

#### Initial Prompts (First prompt in task/issue)
- **Preserve COMPLETE prompt** (up to 8000 chars)
- **Rationale**: Initial prompts establish project context, requirements, and scope
- **Cannot be truncated** as they provide foundational understanding

#### Follow-up Prompts (Subsequent prompts)
- **Preserve first 512 characters exactly**
- **Summarize remainder** in brackets if needed
- **Rationale**: Can reference earlier context, focus on decisions/changes

#### Total Summary Management
- **Priority order**: Full initial prompt > key decisions > implementation details
- **If approaching 8000 chars**: Reduce follow-up summaries, never truncate initial prompt
- **Smart truncation**: Focus on preserving decision-making context over minor details

### Implementation

```bash
# Create scratch file
echo "content" > temp_scratch_pr_comment.md
# Post comment  
gh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body-file temp_scratch_pr_comment.md
# Cleanup
rm temp_scratch_pr_comment.md
```

### Examples

#### Good: Preserving Initial Prompt Context
```
## AI Interaction Summary

**Completed using**: Claude Sonnet in Cursor  
**Total user prompts**: 4

**Chronological History**:

1. "Create a new GitHub repository called 'process-baseline' in the Lullabot organization that provides reusable Cursor AI rules for internal projects. This repo should solve specific AI behavior problems I've experienced across multiple projects. Step 1: Analyze Existing Patterns..." [FULL 2000+ char initial prompt preserved] - establishing complete project requirements and context

2. "let's come back to that cd command. those aren't the wiki files in the lsm-examples repo." - correcting repository analysis approach

3. "yes." - confirming wiki repository approach  

4. "in that AI summary, my original first prompt was truncated. open a new issue, and let's update the ai summary guidelines..." - identifying character limit problem
```

#### Bad: Truncating Critical Initial Context
```
## AI Interaction Summary

**Completed using**: Claude Sonnet in Cursor  
**Total user prompts**: 4

**Chronological History**:

1. "Create a new GitHub repository called 'process-baseline' in the Lullabot organization that provides reusable Cursor AI rules for internal projects. This repo should solve specific AI behavior problems I've experienced across multiple projects. Step 1: Analyze..." [TRUNCATED] - repository creation task
   
[Context lost: pain points, solution approach, success criteria, technical requirements]
```

## Task Switching Protocol (MANDATORY)

**Problem Solved**: Context loss when AI changes focus without proper handoff.

### Requirements

Before switching to new task, you MUST:

1. **Complete current work**: Commit or stash all changes
2. **Document status**: Update relevant tickets/PRs with current status
3. **Post summary**: If task incomplete, explain what's done and what's next
4. **Clean workspace**: Return to main branch if appropriate

### Status Update Template

```
## Current Status
- [x] Completed: [list]
- [ ] In Progress: [current item]
- [ ] Next Steps: [planned work]

## Context for Next Developer
- Key decisions made: [summary]
- Known issues: [any blockers]
- Files modified: [list]
```

## Pull Request Finalization (MANDATORY)

**Problem Solved**: Inconsistent PR practices and missing review steps.

### Pre-Merge Checklist

1. **Linting**: Run `npm run lint:md` and fix violations
2. **Visual Documentation**: Post before/after screenshots
3. **Scope Verification**: Review diff and confirm all changes in scope
4. **Testing Summary**: Document what was tested and what wasn't
5. **Link Issues**: Use "Fixes #123" in PR body
6. **Request Review**: Move to "Ready for Review" status

### Exception Handling

If instructed to use admin override:
1. **Document justification**: Post comment explaining user's reasoning
2. **Use exact justification**: Include user's provided reasoning verbatim
3. **Proceed with caution**: Only if user explicitly authorized

## Customization Guidelines

### What CAN Be Overridden

- Branch naming conventions (document alternative)
- Commit message format (maintain detail requirement)
- Summary frequency (may reduce for prototype work)
- Review process timing (may streamline for hotfixes)

### What CANNOT Be Overridden

- Branch creation requirement (safety critical)
- User approval for commits (prevents accidents)
- AI summary inclusion in final deliverables
- Documentation of exceptions and reasoning

### How to Override

1. **Document in project**: Add to project-specific `.cursor/rules`
2. **Explain reasoning**: Why override is needed
3. **Specify scope**: When override applies
4. **Maintain intent**: Keep the underlying safety/quality goals

### Override Example

```markdown
# Project Override: Fast Prototype Mode
For spike/prototype tickets only:
- MAY skip branch creation for experimental work
- MUST still document all changes in final summary
- MUST create proper branch before any production-bound changes
```

## Error Recovery

If workflow steps are skipped:
1. **Stop current work**: Don't continue until process is followed
2. **Explain requirement**: Reference this baseline and why it matters
3. **Implement correctly**: Follow proper steps even if it means backtracking
4. **Document learning**: Note what went wrong to prevent repetition

These rules exist to prevent costly mistakes and ensure consistent quality across all Lullabot projects. Individual project needs can be accommodated through documented overrides while maintaining core safety principles.
