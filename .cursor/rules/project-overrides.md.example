# Project Override: Fast Prototype Mode

For spike/prototype tickets PROJ-XXX through PROJ-YYY:

## Branch Creation Override
- MAY skip branch creation for experimental work under 4 hours
- MUST create proper branch before any production-bound changes
- MUST document "prototype work" reason in commit messages

## Commit Process Override  
- MAY use simplified commit messages for prototype commits
- MUST still get user approval before committing
- MUST include detailed summary in final handoff

## Documentation Override
- MAY reduce memory bank update frequency during rapid iteration
- MUST complete comprehensive update before task handoff
```

## Example Override: Hotfix Process

```markdown
# Project Override: Emergency Hotfix Protocol

For URGENT tagged tickets only:

## Streamlined Process
- MAY work directly on hotfix branches from main
- MAY skip Plan mode for well-defined emergency fixes
- MUST still document all changes thoroughly
- MUST include detailed testing summary
```

## How to Activate Overrides

1. Copy desired override content above
2. Paste into new `.mdc` file in `.cursor/rules/`
3. Customize for your project's specific needs
4. Document when and why overrides apply
5. Test with team to ensure effectiveness

## Guidelines for Good Overrides

- Be specific about when override applies
- Maintain core safety principles (user approval, documentation)
- Explain reasoning for deviation from baseline
- Include examples of proper usage
- Set clear boundaries and exceptions
